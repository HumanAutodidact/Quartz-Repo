title: "Multitasking"

## Introduction
In high school I often times attempted to juggle two tasks. I would have Netflix playing in the background while I work on homework. While I largely broke this bad habit after starting college, it seems to have come up once again as a result of my Japanese studies. 

## X+Y
My approach to learning Japanese is to immerse myself as much as I can in the language, and I have been trying to constantly have some form of Japanese input at all times if possible. While I don't think it is necessary to do this to obtain a high level of Japanese, I think it can only help your acquisition of Japanese. In any case, the important question that needs to be answered is whether there is enough benefit in trying to do **X+Y** where 

<p style="text-align:center"> <b>X = (homework/class/driving)</b> and <b>Y = (Japanese Podcast/Anime)</b>.  </p>

As I said before, doing **X+Y** can only help my Japanese (sort of, but more on this in a bit...) as I am cramming as much Japanese into my day as possible, but the question is, how much does this take away from accomplishing **X**?

## Problems with X+Y
Now there is an additional issue that needs to be addressed with **X+Y**. On the surface, it seems that this is the optimal path for Japanese, while everything else suffers. However, it is entirely possible that in trying to accomplish **X+Y**, we take much longer than neccesary to complete **X** (no surprises there), and as a result, we are wasting time that we could otherwise use to **ACTIVELY** study Japanese. One thing I have not mentioned until now is that there is a huge difference between **active** and **passive** study of Japanese (I have written about the difference when reading textbooks, but I have since lost the post). 

## Passive vs. Active Study
I believe you don't really get much from passive study of Japanese. I wouldn't say it is pointless (otherwise I wouldn't be trying to do it), but I do think that there is a tradeoff in trying to do it in background while accomplishing cognitively demanding tasks such as **X** (driving is debatable). If you are not doing something important and you are just sitting around with nothing to do, then passively listening to Japanese is better than nothing at all. When listening to Japanese while doing nothing, it doesn't take away from anything when you find that you have switched your attention to the audio and began actively listening to it. However, when you are doing something important while passively listening to Japanese, it takes away from the important task when you switch your attention to the audio. Moreover, it can take a couple of minutes to get back to full speed on the important task after you stop paying attention to the audio.

## Conclusion
In thinking about all of this, I have decided to experiment with limiting the amount of passive Japanese I do this week to a minimum and devote any time (outside of that which is dedicated to my necessary tasks) to **actively** studying Japanese. I will try to post an update with my results.
