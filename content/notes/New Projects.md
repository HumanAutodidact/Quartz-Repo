title: "New Projects"
---

As the title suggests, I am beginning a some projects and recommitting to previous ones that I've started as we are just about to start the new month of October.

I am currently coordinating with my math mentor about solving all of the solutions from a few textbooks I have already started/finished. He is planning on compiling the solutions from all of the students he has led through certain math textbooks. Since I have completed many solutions from some of these textbooks, I offered to help complete the rest of them.

That being said, my goal for the rest of this year is to complete one problem each day from each of these textbooks. Right now there are three of these books that I will have to do this for. Two of them being books that I am actively learning from as I have not completed them yet. This means that completing one problem a day will certainly be a bit of a challenge as some of the problems can take a lot of thinking and require many arguments embedded within other arguments. If not that, then many of the questions simply require a lot of creatively, and it takes time to think of many ways to attack the problems.

I want to do more than just these three books, but I would be adding more on top of college classes, the three self study books, and learning Japanese. At the very least I want to do one physics book, but I find it very hard to study physics at times. Sometimes it is due to the fact that I cannot LaTeX my solutions very easy, and it doesn't feel as motivating since my progress is not trackable as a result. There are many diagrams you have to draw in solving a physics problem that makes LaTeXing the solutions pretty much impossible if you intend on making them look good.

If we do some simple calculations, we can see that a normal day of doing three problems would result in about 3 hours worth of work, as I would have to solve the problems and LaTeX them. Japanese needs at the very least 3 hours a day dedicated to Anki alone. I study 2 hours a day for my classes. We are at 8 hours total. I could keep adding and adding, but at this point are going to be pushing the limit of what I am able to consistenly do EVERY day. Sure I could do this 5 days out of the week, but then I have to go to school 2 days out of the week, and I spend time getting ready to go to school, driving to and from school, walking around campus, and so on. 

I will end this post for now, but I may add to it later.
