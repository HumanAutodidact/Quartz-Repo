title: "Mastery-Based Learning"

I have heard from multiple experienced mathematicians that math should be learned bit by bit. Learning mathematics is like stacking blocks on top of each other. The foundations must be strong, and if not then the entire knowledge structure falls apart. Learning mathematics is also like linking chains together. Each of these logical chains are lengthened piece by piece. In this post I want to discuss mastery-based learning in comparison with a different learning objective.

## What is mastery-based learning?

The idea behind mastery-based learning (MBL) is that one should practice concepts until they are thoroughly understood and exercised. In essence, it is practicing until mastery is achieved. Now the definition for mastery is up for debate since this may be different across various domains of study, but it is the core philosophical objective of mastery-based learning that I am highlighting in this post. In thinking about MBL, it helps to take a look at a learning objective that has a different focus: The Pareto Principle. The Pareto principle applied to learning could state many consequences. Here are a few.

80% of your class grade comes from 20% of your learning efforts. Thus, in order to be as efficient as possible when learning in a time crunch, put forth effort where it gives the majority of learning benefits. Don’t use 80% of your time while only learning 20% of the material.

MBL would encourage mastery over all prerequisite material before moving on, while the Pareto principle encourages getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to time and effort applied. My thoughts on these two approaches depends entirely on the context.

## Self-Directed vs. Classroom Learning

We mainly have two different learning contexts: self-directed and classroom learning.

Classroom learning is typically done in the presence of a professor, and is usually quite a passive experience if it is not a lab science course. This is best when you need a quick overview to a subject as you will have an experienced guide that knows common pitfalls, but due to time constraints there is usually not enough time to go in depth with particular topics.

Self-directed learning (otherwise known as self-study) is learning that occurs outside of the classroom environment and it is where the vast majority of learning is done by an individual. In this type of study, topics can take much longer to understand, but once complete then the understanding is much deeper when compared to classroom learning.

## What learning method should be followed?

In the context of a classroom, self-directed learning has its limitations. When the artificial time constraints of the classroom seep into an individual’s attempt to deeply understand a topic, then self-directed learning will be much harder to complete. We need a more efficient learning method for the given timeframe, and one that considers the fact that other courses need to fit into one’s study schedule. The Pareto principle is quite good in this scenario and should likely be followed. Any further study into topics should be done out of interest or an abundance of time. However, when attempting to gain knowledge that has no deadline, self-directed learning is the best option available. It provides the deepest understanding of material and will then give the firm foundation for further knowledge to be built on. Each student has different needs when it comes to the time required to understand a subject thoroughly and this is why self-directed learning provides the deepest understanding outside of an artificial time constraint.

## How do we know that mastery-based learning works?

One of the primary examples of implementation of MBL is Khan Academy. They rely heavily on this method as their educators consistently mention that Khan Academy is to be used as much as a student needs (eliminating the artificial time constraint) and the quizzes are meant to test a students knowledge of bite sized topics (which builds knowledge bit by bit). Khan Academy has been wildly successful as a result of this implementation and it is a true testament to MBL.

## Conclusion

Using MBL while learning mathematics aims to deepen a student’s knowledge base by giving them ample time to cover material. I recommend that educators pursue the implementation of MBL as much possible within the current academic system. While the most optimal way to implement this method will require further thought, it is clear that MBL is a great way to allow students at all levels to have the opportunity to gain the fundamental knowledge required for their area of study.
