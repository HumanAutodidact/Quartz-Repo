While this post is geared towards self-studying mathematics, I believe that much of this advice can be applied to any subject. So I encourage readers from any discipline to find some useful information from this post. To clarify, I will not be giving a list of textbooks/materials to be used for self study, rather, I will be giving advice on how to plan a self-studying project. Some of this information is subjective, so if the reader finds that they would prefer a different method, then I would encourage them to explore what methods work best for them.

## Why?

This question should be the cornerstone of your self-study project in mathematics. If you do not have a strong “why?”, then you might not make it past the first week, or month of self-study. Here are some examples.

-   I want to learn this information for my degree.
-   I want to learn this information for my job.
-   I want to learn this information because mathematics is engaging to me.

As you can see, each of these reasons provide sufficient motivation to self-study mathematics. However, I want to quickly point out the difference between the first two reasons, and the last. The first two reasons are external motivators, while the third is an internal motivator. I will not dwell on this, but if you want to maximize the effect of a “why?”, try to convert an external motivator to an internal motivator. This is much more effective in maintaining a positive attitude toward mathematics, and prevents one from feeling that self-study is a forced activity.

## How?

How are you going to structure your self-study project? How much time do you have to study? How much material do you intend to cover? These are all questions that need to be answered before beginning your project. Most people will have a time frame that they want to complete their project in, so these questions are geared towards short-term self-study projects. I advise that you answer these questions as specifically as possible in order to help set up monthly/weekly/daily goals. Goals are very important in the work/reward system of humans, and by setting manageable goals, you can further motivate yourself to keep striving for more.

Notice that up to this point, I have spoken multiple times about motivation. This is the limiting factor in every mathematics self-study project I have seen someone undertake. So for this next section, I will cover how to work in times of low motivation.

## Habits

Habits are actions that occur repeatedly, and are typically completed without much thought. In order to study when motivation is low, one can rely on habits that have been built over weeks. This is why it is important to be consistent with your study. While I will not say that self-study has to occur every day, I highly advise any reader to find 15 minutes to devote to self-study each day as a minimum. This way, one is always taking steps forward toward the completion of their self-study project. It may be difficult to stay disciplined to this activity in the first few days, but one may find that once they begin working, they study for much longer than they expected. Some days you may only do the 15 minutes as required, but other days can be extremely productive, and it is all rooted in the fact that you started small. If you do any more than the 15 minutes, then you are studying because you feel like it. This helps since you are giving yourself the opportunity to study via an internal motivation, and not the external goal of studying for a long time. If you set the bar much higher at 2 hours instead, this means you will be doing 2 hours of forced work before you have the opportunity to be internally motivated. Unless you are extremely hard-working, most people will not be able to do this 2 hours of study daily for many reasons. The main reason is that self-study is not required. Another reason is that many hours of quiet, undistracted time can be very difficult to find each day. Therefore, one should try to build smaller, more reliable study habits.

## Conclusion

Asking the right questions is the beginning of one’s self-study journey in mathematics (Why? How?). Figuring out the logistics is necessary to have a successful project. Self-study is limited by a persons ability to motivate themselves to study each day. Therefore, we should find the best ways to tap into motivation (External/Internal Motivation). Also, we should create a failsafe for when we have low motivation (Habits). This way, one is always moving forward towards their objective.
