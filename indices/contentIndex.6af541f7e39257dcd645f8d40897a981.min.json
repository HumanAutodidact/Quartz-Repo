So I encourage readers from any discipline to find some useful information from this post. To clarify, I will not be giving a list of textbooks/materials to be used for self study, rather, I will be giving advice on how to plan a self-studying project. Some of this information is subjective, so if the reader finds that they would prefer a different method, then I would encourage them to explore what methods work best for them.\n\n## Why?\n\nThis question should be the cornerstone of your self-study project in mathematics. If you do not have a strong “why?”, then you might not make it past the first week, or month of self-study. Here are some examples.\n\n-   I want to learn this information for my degree.\n-   I want to learn this information for my job.\n-   I want to learn this information because mathematics is engaging to me.\n\nAs you can see, each of these reasons provide sufficient motivation to self-study mathematics. However, I want to quickly point out the difference between the first two reasons, and the last. The first two reasons are external motivators, while the third is an internal motivator. I will not dwell on this, but if you want to maximize the effect of a “why?”, try to convert an external motivator to an internal motivator. This is much more effective in maintaining a positive attitude toward mathematics, and prevents one from feeling that self-study is a forced activity.\n\n## How?\n\nHow are you going to structure your self-study project? How much time do you have to study? How much material do you intend to cover? These are all questions that need to be answered before beginning your project. Most people will have a time frame that they want to complete their project in, so these questions are geared towards short-term self-study projects. I advise that you answer these questions as specifically as possible in order to help set up monthly/weekly/daily goals. Goals are very important in the work/reward system of humans, and by setting manageable goals, you can further motivate yourself to keep striving for more.\n\nNotice that up to this point, I have spoken multiple times about motivation. This is the limiting factor in every mathematics self-study project I have seen someone undertake. So for this next section, I will cover how to work in times of low motivation.\n\n## Habits\n\nHabits are actions that occur repeatedly, and are typically completed without much thought. In order to study when motivation is low, one can rely on habits that have been built over weeks. This is why it is important to be consistent with your study. While I will not say that self-study has to occur every day, I highly advise any reader to find 15 minutes to devote to self-study each day as a minimum. This way, one is always taking steps forward toward the completion of their self-study project. It may be difficult to stay disciplined to this activity in the first few days, but one may find that once they begin working, they study for much longer than they expected. Some days you may only do the 15 minutes as required, but other days can be extremely productive, and it is all rooted in the fact that you started small. If you do any more than the 15 minutes, then you are studying because you feel like it. This helps since you are giving yourself the opportunity to study via an internal motivation, and not the external goal of studying for a long time. If you set the bar much higher at 2 hours instead, this means you will be doing 2 hours of forced work before you have the opportunity to be internally motivated. Unless you are extremely hard-working, most people will not be able to do this 2 hours of study daily for many reasons. The main reason is that self-study is not required. Another reason is that many hours of quiet, undistracted time can be very difficult to find each day. Therefore, one should try to build smaller, more reliable study habits.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAsking the right questions is the beginning of one’s self-study journey in mathematics (Why? How?). Figuring out the logistics is necessary to have a successful project. Self-study is limited by a persons ability to motivate themselves to study each day. Therefore, we should find the best ways to tap into motivation (External/Internal Motivation). Also, we should create a failsafe for when we have low motivation (Habits). This way, one is always moving forward towards their objective.","lastmodified":"2022-09-26T00:39:04.296974329Z","tags":null},"/notes/Mastery-Based-Learning":{"title":"Mastery-Based Learning","content":"\nI have heard from multiple experienced mathematicians that math should be learned bit by bit. Learning mathematics is like stacking blocks on top of each other. The foundations must be strong, and if not then the entire knowledge structure falls apart. Learning mathematics is also like linking chains together. Each of these logical chains are lengthened piece by piece. In this post I want to discuss mastery-based learning in comparison with a different learning objective.\n\n## What is mastery-based learning?\n\nThe idea behind mastery-based learning (MBL) is that one should practice concepts until they are thoroughly understood and exercised. In essence, it is practicing until mastery is achieved. Now the definition for mastery is up for debate since this may be different across various domains of study, but it is the core philosophical objective of mastery-based learning that I am highlighting in this post. In thinking about MBL, it helps to take a look at a learning objective that has a different focus: The Pareto Principle. The Pareto principle applied to learning could state many consequences. Here are a few.\n\n80% of your class grade comes from 20% of your learning efforts. Thus, in order to be as efficient as possible when learning in a time crunch, put forth effort where it gives the majority of learning benefits. Don’t use 80% of your time while only learning 20% of the material.\n\nMBL would encourage mastery over all prerequisite material before moving on, while the Pareto principle encourages getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to time and effort applied. My thoughts on these two approaches depends entirely on the context.\n\n## Self-Directed vs. Classroom Learning\n\nWe mainly have two different learning contexts: self-directed and classroom learning.\n\nClassroom learning is typically done in the presence of a professor, and is usually quite a passive experience if it is not a lab science course. This is best when you need a quick overview to a subject as you will have an experienced guide that knows common pitfalls, but due to time constraints there is usually not enough time to go in depth with particular topics.\n\nSelf-directed learning (otherwise known as self-study) is learning that occurs outside of the classroom environment and it is where the vast majority of learning is done by an individual. In this type of study, topics can take much longer to understand, but once complete then the understanding is much deeper when compared to classroom learning.\n\n## What learning method should be followed?\n\nIn the context of a classroom, self-directed learning has its limitations. When the artificial time constraints of the classroom seep into an individual’s attempt to deeply understand a topic, then self-directed learning will be much harder to complete. We need a more efficient learning method for the given timeframe, and one that considers the fact that other courses need to fit into one’s study schedule. The Pareto principle is quite good in this scenario and should likely be followed. Any further study into topics should be done out of interest or an abundance of time. However, when attempting to gain knowledge that has no deadline, self-directed learning is the best option available. It provides the deepest understanding of material and will then give the firm foundation for further knowledge to be built on. Each student has different needs when it comes to the time required to understand a subject thoroughly and this is why self-directed learning provides the deepest understanding outside of an artificial time constraint.\n\n## How do we know that mastery-based learning works?\n\nOne of the primary examples of implementation of MBL is Khan Academy. They rely heavily on this method as their educators consistently mention that Khan Academy is to be used as much as a student needs (eliminating the artificial time constraint) and the quizzes are meant to test a students knowledge of bite sized topics (which builds knowledge bit by bit). Khan Academy has been wildly successful as a result of this implementation and it is a true testament to MBL.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing MBL while learning mathematics aims to deepen a student’s knowledge base by giving them ample time to cover material. I recommend that educators pursue the implementation of MBL as much possible within the current academic system. While the most optimal way to implement this method will require further thought, it is clear that MBL is a great way to allow students at all levels to have the opportunity to gain the fundamental knowledge required for their area of study.","lastmodified":"2022-09-26T00:39:04.296974329Z","tags":null}}
